In this file, I(Aayush) have stored my assets. This asset is just a simple cube. It 
has a .prefab extention (for the cube prefab) and a .meta extention, which Unity
keeps when dealing with import/export.

HOW TO IMPORT THE CUBE TO YOUR PROJECT: 

Take both the Cube.prefab and Cube.prefab.meta, copy them, and paste(or drag and 
drop to your project), and voila! You have the same cube in your project as I have 
in mine. 
Thats it.

PS: Remember, I sent you the Prefab only, you need to drag the cube into your
hierarchy(or to the Scene) and you're done.
